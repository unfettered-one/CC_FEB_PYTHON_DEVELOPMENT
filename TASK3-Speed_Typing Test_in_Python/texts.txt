I don't believe in destiny
I just do what's best for me
Don't listen to my enemies
They're just full of jealousy
Duh
This legacy
You gon' see what's left of me
You gon' see success in me
You ain't seen the rest of me
I just wanna be the best at what I know
Better than the rest, just watch me grow
Put me to the test and watch me go
This is my quest, I'ma make it known
They call me obsessive, oh I know
Call me selective with my notes
Call me aggressive with my flow
Call me offensive, even though
So we ain't gonna lie, life's tough
Tryna get by, life's rough
Try to do it right, It's not enough
Even though you try, you still mess up
But I'm still gonna fight for what I love
Still gonna die for what I love
Still gonna try, I won't give up
Still gonna fight until I've won
They say I'm way too obsessed
And I've got nothing left
And I'm not quite there yet
But those words they'll regret
'Cause I've got something left
And I'm not giving in
I will not let them win
I won't stop 'til the end, no
I've been through some injuries, mentally and physically
Studied them religiously, so I don't repeat history
And people won't admit to me, they don't want a victory
Bad enough to get a seat, they'd rather just go leave it be
And oh, this journey
I've been on since 13, working hard and learning
Never stopping searching, yeah
It's burning, all this passion hurts me
I took action working, writing down these words he
No, I'm not okay
I just wanna be something
I don't wanna be nothing
Living all alone
No, I'm not alright
I'm just barely getting by
But I'll tell you I'm just fine
So you leave me alone
They say I'm way too obsessed
And I've got nothing left
And I'm not quite there yet
But those words they'll regret
'Cause I've got something left
And I'm not giving in
I will not let them win
I won't stop 'til the end, no
